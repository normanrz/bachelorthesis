\chapter{Client Application Architecture}

\section{Overview}
The client application of Project Zoom is a web-based application. It can be run using a HTML5-capable web browser. The client application accesses the server's resources through a HTTP-REST interface. The code is partitioned into several modules. An architectural pattern similar to Model-View-Controller (MVC) is applied.

\subsection{MVC pattern}
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern was first introduced to the Smalltalk platform by Reenskaug in 1979 \cite{Reenskaug_1979} and later published by Krasner in 1988 \cite{Krasner_1988}. It was one of the first approaches to seperate business and presentation logic code within a software project.
